Customer Engagement Analysis using E-commerce Dataset
Project Overview
This project aims to explore customer behavior patterns within an e-commerce dataset to identify insights that could help improve customer engagement. The dataset contains information such as product categories, purchase quantities, feedback ratings, and customer demographic details. By analyzing these patterns, we can better understand how customers interact with the platform and what drives higher engagement.

Objectives:
Explore the data to identify trends in customer behavior.
Develop a simple model to predict customer engagement.
Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement based on the analysis.
Approach
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
We started by exploring the dataset to understand the structure and key features. The dataset was cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing data, particularly using median imputation for numerical fields.

2. Feature Engineering
Several features were created to help assess customer engagement:

EngagementScore: A combined score based on quantity purchased, product price, session time, and customer feedback.
HighEngagement: A binary target variable indicating whether a customer has high or low engagement, based on the EngagementScore.
DaysSinceLastPurchase: Calculated as the difference between the current date and the last purchase date to measure recency.
3. Model Development
A Random Forest Classifier was used to predict high customer engagement. The model was trained on various features and evaluated using accuracy score and classification report. Feature importance was also analyzed to identify which factors are most influential in driving engagement.

Key Findings
Engagement Drivers: Features such as the quantity of items purchased, session time, and product price were found to be the most important indicators of customer engagement.
Behavioral Patterns: High engagement is generally linked to larger purchases and customers who spend more time interacting with the platform.
Feedback Influence: Customer feedback ratings have some influence on engagement but were less impactful than transactional behaviors.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve customer engagement:

Target High-Engagement Customers: Develop targeted retention strategies for high-engagement customers to increase lifetime value.
Improve Session Time: Focus on enhancing the user experience by optimizing session time through personalized recommendations or faster navigation.
Leverage Customer Feedback: Collect and analyze more detailed feedback to refine product offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For model building and evaluation (Random Forest Classifier).
Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, with actionable recommendations to boost engagement and drive product improvements. The findings can help inform future marketing strategies and product enhancements for the e-commerce platform.

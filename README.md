# E-commerce Project: Customer Engagement Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to explore customer behavior patterns within an e-commerce dataset to identify insights that could help improve customer engagement. The dataset contains information such as product categories, purchase quantities, feedback ratings, and customer demographic details. By analyzing these patterns, we can better understand how customers interact with the platform and what drives higher engagement.

## **Objectives**
- Explore the data to identify trends in customer behavior.
- Develop a simple model to predict customer engagement.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement based on the analysis.

## **Approach**

### **1. Data Exploration & Cleaning**
We started by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and key features. The dataset was cleaned by:
- Removing irrelevant columns.
- Handling missing data, particularly using median imputation for numerical fields.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
Several features were created to assess customer engagement:
- **EngagementScore**: A combined score based on quantity purchased, product price, session time, and customer feedback.
- **HighEngagement**: A binary target variable indicating whether a customer has high or low engagement, based on the `EngagementScore`.
- **DaysSinceLastPurchase**: Calculated as the difference between the current date and the last purchase date to measure recency.

### **3. Model Development**
A **Random Forest Classifier** was used to predict high customer engagement. Key steps included:
- Training the model on various features.
- Evaluating the model using accuracy score and classification report.
- Analyzing feature importance to identify the most influential factors driving engagement.

## **Key Findings**
- **Engagement Drivers**: Features such as quantity of items purchased, session time, and product price are the most important indicators of customer engagement.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: High engagement is linked to larger purchases and customers who spend more time interacting with the platform.
- **Feedback Influence**: Customer feedback ratings have some influence on engagement but are less impactful than transactional behaviors.

## **Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve customer engagement:
1. **Target High-Engagement Customers**  
   Develop targeted retention strategies for high-engagement customers to increase lifetime value.
2. **Improve Session Time**  
   Focus on enhancing the user experience by optimizing session time through personalized recommendations or faster navigation.
3. **Leverage Customer Feedback**  
   Collect and analyze more detailed feedback to refine product offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
